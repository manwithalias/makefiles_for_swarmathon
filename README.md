# makefiles_for_swarmathon

I am part of the 2017 swarmathon robotics class at CNM.  These makefiles were made to go in the rover_workspace folder on a laptop that runs the ROS code needed to control the swarmies.

There is a lot that goes into having a team, and the ability quickly load the latest code off github and compile it is a great advantage.  

Each time the rovers move to a new location, they need to be recalibrated.  These make files will speed up the process.

These makefiles allow you to quickly download code from github, compile it, run it, and calibrate the rovers.  

They provide improvements to speed up communication between you and the rovers for faster development.

Just copy both makefile and Makefile into your rover_workspace on your laptop, fill in required variable info at the top of each file, cd to the rover_workspace folder, type 'make' on the commandline in linux, and you will get further instructions.
